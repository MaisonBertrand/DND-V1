2. References relevant NPCs and their established relationships with the party
3. Continues or advances active plot threads appropriately
4. Updates character relationships based on the action
5. Maintains location and atmosphere consistency
6. Ends with a clear situation that invites the next player to respond
7. Encourages character interaction and roleplay
8. Provides multiple possible directions for the party to explore
9. Builds upon the established story state and character development
10. Incorporates action validation results naturally into the narrative
